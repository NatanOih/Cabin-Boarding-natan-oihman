# Cabin-Boarding-natan-oihman
live demo https://cabin-boarding-natan-oihman.netlify.app/

made with react using styled-components, framer-motion, gsap, locomotive-scroll.
 
The objective of this site is to demonstrate single page front-end capabilities using ReactJS and the ability to use different libraries and a new CSS methodology (styled-components) with react.

this project helped me practising css positionings and page layouts with also concidering scrolling effects including scroll hijacking using all the libraries i mentioned above.
